## About The Foundry Company

**The Foundry Company (TFC)** is a full-suite construction service operating on the [CivMC](https://civmc.net/wiki/) Minecraft server, headquartered in the Kingdom of Karpatia. We turn your Litematica schematics into fully built, block-perfect structures anywhere on the map.

TFC is incorporated as a **Section §13 Business under Article VI**, registered with the Kingdom of Karpatia Bureau of Commerce (KBC), and operates in compliance with Imperial Federation law.

### What We Do

- **Build from Schematics** — Provide a `.litematic` file and we handle the rest, from small utilities to massive megaprojects.
- **Material Sourcing** — We gather all required resources so you don't have to grind.
- **Project Management** — Dedicated Project Administrators manage your order from first contact to final delivery.
- **Multi-Timezone Coverage** — Our team operates across timezones to keep your project moving forward.

> *You bring the ideas and the schematic — we take care of the rest.*

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  You design  │────▶│  Submit a .lite-  │────▶│  We source    │────▶│  We build it │
│  in creative │     │  matic schematic  │     │  materials    │     │  on-location  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

1. **Design** your build in creative mode and export it as a `.litematic` file using [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica).
2. **Submit** your order through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KN4dtZmy6Q) in the `🛠️｜submit-order` channel.
3. **We estimate** the project cost (materials + labor) and provide a transparent quote.
4. **We build** — our Construction Specialists execute your schematic block-by-block at your desired location.
5. **You receive** a completed build matching your original design.

## Intellectual Property & Trust

We take client IP seriously:

- **Your schematics are yours.** TFC never claims ownership of client `.litematic` files or designs.
- **Secure handling.** Files are securely stored with limited internal access during active projects.
- **Deleted on completion.** All client schematic files are removed from our systems when a project is finished.
- **Zero tolerance.** Unauthorized sale, redistribution, or reuse of client files results in immediate staff termination.

For full details, see our [Client Intellectual Property Rights](https://discord.gg/KN4dtZmy6Q) policy on Discord.
